A web apllication developed with React/JavaScript that generate a robot based on the user's input name using RoboHash API. The API will take in a string and hash it, then generate a robot based on that hash.

- Try adding your name or a celebrity's name and see what you would look like as a robot.
- The search box allows you to filter the robots by name. Try adding your family in and filter by last name to see if the robots have anything in common.
